Brief first practice on how to build blocks and chain them together

This tutorial was created using a mix of two articles:
1. https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-blockchain-i
2. https://python.plainenglish.io/create-your-own-cryptocurrency-blockchain-in-python-3-9-4-806f8825608e

Neither article was great, either lacking in explanation or needing some editing of the code for simple errors.
